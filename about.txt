 Currently im persuing my Master Of Computer Application degree at
            Goa University. I completed my six months of internship at Goa
            Institute of Management, as a Associate Web Developer. I have a
            passion for designing and building websites that are not only
            visually appealing, but also highly functional and easy to navigate.
            Feel free to reach out to me at suygchari@gmail.com. I'd love to
            hear about your project and see how I can help bring your vision to
            life!
